# Briink - Coding Task for Web Development Internship

This simple Next.js project is the beginning of an online cookbook. It has a simple user interface which should allow the user to select a main ingredient from a dropdown list, and based on the selection, it should display a list of the remaining ingredients. Currently, the existing code does not do this correctly. Your task is to fix this behavior, fix any other issues you may find, and improve the appearance of the page in any way you like.

## Detailed Instructions

1. Fix the error in `api/cookbook`.
2. In the frontend, remove the hardcoded `ingredients` object and fetch the data instead from `api/cookbook`.
3. Please also fix the behavior of the frontend, so that the selected main ingredient will NOT appear in the list of remaining ingredients.
4. After fixing all the issues, please feel free to write your own CSS and/or use any UI framework (e.g. Material, Bootstrap, etc.) to make the page more visually appealing.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run locally:

```
